# Week 5: Advanced Techniques in ML

* [Day 1] General Ensembling Techniques
    - bagging
    - stacking
    - boosting
    - ensembling with mlextend
    - [Hands-on]
        * Create ensembles for models created in Supervised ML week Day 2, 3, 4, 5
* [Day 2] Toolbox for Machine Learning
    - Argparse
    - Optparse
    - Structuring your work as a Python package
    - Monte-carlo Simulations
    - A/B Testing
    - [Hands-on]
        * Spanish language A/B testing Dataset
        * Creating commandline scripts for the solution
        * Releasing the solution as a Python package
* [Day 3] Challenges
    - Handling class-imbalance (SMOTE etc)
    - Hyperparameter Tuning (Grid Search vs Random Search)
    - Do we need hundreds of classifiers?
    - How much cross-validation?
    - Not enough data (bootstrapping)
    - Machine Learning and Products (design and metrics)
    - [Hands-on]
        * SMOTE
            - model building
            - visualization
            - comparison of performance against imbalanced datasets
        * Hyperparameter tuning
        * Bootstrapping from a very small dataset
* [Day 4] Deeper into NLP
    - Scraping Data
    - Classification
    - Sentiment Analysis
* [Day 5] Deeper into NLP
    - Word embeddings (and classification)
    - Topic Modeling (and classification)
    - Analysing Data Science job postings
